This is a Shiny application that accepts an n-gram as input and predicts the next word.  Please be patient while the app initializes; this takes roughly 5 seconds.
        
The following steps can be followed to use this app:
        
1. In the left-hand sidebar panel, insert the partial sentence you would like us to analyze
2. On tab 2 (*Word Prediction*), we will provide you the top six words that have the highest probability to be the next word in your sentence.
3. On tab 3 (*Word Cloud*), we provide you with a little analytic artwork that displays the top 50 words most likely to follow your partial sentence input.

**Note:** For more information on the prediction algorithm used in this app please reference the word prediction [presentation](http://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/word_prediction)
